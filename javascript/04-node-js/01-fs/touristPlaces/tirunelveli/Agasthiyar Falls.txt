According to Hindu legend, during the divine wedding of Shiva and Parvathi at Kailash, Sage Agasthya couldn't witness the event due to the heavy crowd. He prayed at this spot to Shiva to grant him a view, and Shiva, pleased by his devotion, appeared with Parvathi in marriage attire, making it his abode, known as Papansanathar. The nearby falls were named Agasthiyar Falls after the sage. Another legend tells of Sage Urosamar, who floated flowers in the Tamiraparani River; the first flower reached this spot, where he established a temple for Papanasanathar.
