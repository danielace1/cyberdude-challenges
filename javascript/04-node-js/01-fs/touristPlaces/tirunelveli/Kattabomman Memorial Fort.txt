This is the site of the ruined fortress of the late 18th century chieftain Kattabomman who faught the British East India Company, lost and was hanged. A folk hero to many. The beautiful structure is a modern memorial built in the 1970's. Pretty. The compound has the foundations of the old fortress which is of more interest to the history buff.
